Leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict running distances, heart rates, and calorie expenditure for optimized fitness tracking and performance enhancement. 


Hey folks! Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm diving into the exciting world of predictive analytics, specifically tailored for fitness enthusiasts like you and me! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™

**Distance Prediction Section:**

Ever wondered if you could predict how far you'd run based on various factors like time, elevation, and heart rate? Well, wonder no more! With this section of the code, I'm leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically Linear Regression, to do just that. By preprocessing running data from my personal collection, I'm training a model to make accurate distance predictions. And hey, we're evaluating its performance using Mean Squared Error to ensure it's on point!

**Prediction of Heart Rate Using RNN:**

Now, let's kick it up a notch with some deep learning magic! In this section, I'm delving into the fascinating realm of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict heart rates. By preprocessing time series data and architecting a sweet RNN model with Keras, I'm aiming to capture those intricate patterns in heart rate fluctuations. And you bet, we're not just stopping at training; we're evaluating our model's chops using Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error, and boy, the results are thrilling!

**Calories Prediction Section:**

Who doesn't want to know how many calories they've burned during a killer workout, right? That's where this section comes into play. Armed with an arsenal of features like time, pace, and heart rate, I'm building not one, but two models! Yep, one for predicting calories burned and another for average heart rate. Using trusty ol' Linear Regression, I'm crafting models that'll give us insights into our fitness journey. And of course, we're checking their performance using mean absolute error because, hey, accuracy matters!

So, there you have it, folks! This repository isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about empowering you to understand and optimize your fitness endeavors through the magic of data science. Join me on this journey to unlock the secrets hidden within our workout data!
